# ZayoProject
In this project I was tasked to create a functional CRUD ROI calculator. One that would take in expense and revenue items with
one-time, as well as monthly costs. From there it would calculate several other things, such as total revenue and expense. 
Monthly contribution profits, total contribution profits, contribution margins, and capital ROI.
